Objective: During this homework, we implemented CRUD operations for both Employee and Company entities. We created controllers to handle HTTP requests with API and developed test cases to ensure the repository methods functioned correctly.

Reflective:  collaborative

Interpretive: Through this exercise, we improved our understanding of Spring Boot and enhanced our problem-solving skills. The session also strengthened our teamwork and communication, which are crucial for successful pair programming.

Decisional: Moving forward, we plan to apply the concepts we've learned to future projects. I am not sure that this would help our daily programming but I guess practicing pair programming to further refine our skills and can definitely help share domain knowledge between two programmers.
